## Portfolio with html, css and javascript.##

I have used javascript for the expandeble button in my Cv.
I have also used Javascript to feth the weather and print that out on the aboutMe page, the weather were the visitor is.
The same site that i fetch the weather from also provided the weather icons and the weather in swedish. I have tried to make the text as good as possible to fit with all the different weathers..
I have used.toLowercase so that the weather should blend in nicely. i use a different color on the font to make it pop.

**WCAG**

- I have choosen a font that are easy to read and i have increased the spaces between the rows and the letter spacing for extra god visibility 1.4.12.
- I use a background colour to show where one textblock stops and a new section begins. I have made sure that i use a good contrast between the text and the backgound 1.4.3.
- The language of the page are stated in the boilerplate 3.1 1.
- I have used semantic HTML. 4.1.1 the HTML code are validated in the W3C Validator.

- Form, contact me form, uses autocompleat and marks the fields according to WCAG WCAG 1.3.5
